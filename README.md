## FeedReader Testing

This web page provides an example of jasmine testing on a feed reader application presented in the original project on github [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). 

### Installation, or How To Run

Download from the git repo by clicking on the green Clone or download button on the upper right side and selecting Download Zip.
Unzip the files to your computer making sure to preserve the directory structure with the css, fonts, jasmine and js folders as shown on GitHub.
Open index.html in web browser. You can do this by putting the path to the file in the address bar of the web browser (i.e. file:///Users/username/Documents/index.html).    The test result will display at the bottom of the page.

Some guidance was obtained from the following forum posts:

* [Menu Visibility Question] (https://discussions.udacity.com/t/menu-visibility-when-icon-is-clicked/183050) - to undertsand the concept that the it block could make function calls.

* [Callback Question](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/async-tests-on-the-feed-reader/162846/2) - to help with proper number of callbacks.
